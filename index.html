<h1>GIS GE example clients</h1>          

<p>Following links are to the different example clients which can be used for verifying GIS GE basic functionality. Purpose of these clients is to be educational and give an idea how GIS GE can be used for creating 3D scenes.Requirement for succesfully running these examples requires that GIS GE server has been configured as described in the <a href="http://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/GIS_Data_Provider_-_Installation_and_Administration_Guide">Installation guide</a> and <a href="http://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/GIS_Data_Provider_-_Unit_Testing_Plan">in the Unit testing plan</a>. Used test asset in the examples is elevation data from the square area which one side 6km long. Web client's scenemanager in all examples work so that whole test asset area (bounding box) is divided to 5x5 grid, and new grid block is dynamically loaded regarding camera position in the terrain. First block to be loaded is lower left corner of the terrain layer.

<p>
<b>Camera control in the example clients</b> </br>

Camera can be moved with keyboard by using <i>arrow</i> -keys or <i>"A,S,D,W"</i> -keys.
Camera elevation can be increased by pressing <i>space</i> -key, and decreased with <i>"C" </i>-key.
Orientation can be changed by pressing and keeping mouse left button pressed and moving mouse.

<h3>Example clients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="GIS_Client_xml3d/index.xhtml">XML3D object example client</a></li>
         <ul>
             <li>Example client creates queries which response is 3D object definition of the queried terrain area.
                 Client places received XML3D definition directly to the DOM tree, which leads rendering terrain object to the display.</li>
             <li>When server is properly configured, 3D building models can be placed to the terrain with selecting them in <i>Select objects</i> -section.
                <ul>
                    <li>XML3D client assumes that terrain layer contains <i>"terrain"</i> -as part of the name.
                        When this criteria is met layer name is set to <i>"Select terrain layer"</i> list</li>
                    <li>In case layer name doesn't contain <i>"terrain"</i> client interprets that layer contains
                        geolocation points for 3D objects and URI's to object definition location. </li>
                </ul>
             </li>
             <li>Test asset PostGis data contains different level of details information. This can be tested bu using <i>Set Level Of Details</i> list, LOD values between 4-10 are used.</li>
             <li>Client supports metric coordinates, example source data in TM35 coordinate.</li>
         </ul>
         <br/>
         <li><a href="GIS_Client_assetInstancing/index.xhtml">Asset instance example client</a></li>
           <ul>
            <li>This example demonstrates GIS GE capability to create and provide 3D terrain object files,
                which can be referenced directly from the DOM instead of adding whole object definition to the DOM tree.
                Benefit of this approach is cleaner DOM tree even with complicated scenes.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <li><a href="GIS_Client_DEM/index.xhtml">Example client for DEM Geotiff usage as for source for 3D terrain.</a></li>
           <ul>
            <li>Here is demonstration of using greyscale DEM model as for source to 3D terrain creation.
                Data response is in octet-stream format, which contains elevation points for the queried area. This data is used as a source for creating XML3D terrain model.
            <ul>
                <li>If new user defined DEM models are uploaded to the server, client expects that layer name contains <b>DEM</b>. When "DEM" is found from the
                layer name, client adds layer as a new option for the terrain elevation source.</li>
            </ul></li>
           <li>Client expects that source data supports CRS84 definition.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <li><a href="GIS_Client_octet-stream/index.xhtml">Octet-stream example client</a></li>
           <ul>
            <li>Example client queries elevation data which response format is octet-stream. This data is used as a source for creating 3D terrain. </li>
        </ul>	
    </ul>

<br><br>
<b>Please note:</b> If new data sources are introduced to the server, it is important to verify that layer for the new data source contains correct coordinate information.
If false coordinate information is defined to the layer, client is not able to properly display GIS data.
