<h1>GIS GE example clients</h1>          

<p>Following links are to the different example clients which can be used for verifying GIS GE basic functionality. Purpose of these clients is to be educational and give an idea how GIS GE can be used for creating 3D scenes.Requirement for succesfully running these examples requires that GIS GE server has been configured as described in the <a href="http://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/GIS_Data_Provider_-_Installation_and_Administration_Guide">Installation guide</a> and <a href="http://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/GIS_Data_Provider_-_Unit_Testing_Plan">in the Unit testing plan</a>. Used test asset in the examples is elevation data from the square area which one side 6km long. Web client's scenemanager in all examples work so that whole test asset area (bounding box) is divided to 5x5 grid, and new grid block is dynamically loaded regarding camera position in the terrain. First block to be loaded is lower left corner of the terrain layer.

<p>
<b>Camera control in the example clients</b> </br>

Camera can be moved with keyboard by using <i>arrow</i> -keys or <i>"A,S,D,W"</i> -keys. Camera elevation can be increased by pressing <i>space</i> -key, and descreased with <i>"C" </i>-key. Oriantation can be changed by pressing and keeping mouse left button pressed and moving mouse.

<h3>Example clients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="GIS_Client_xml3d/index.xhtml">XML3D object example client</a></li>
         <ul>
             <li>Example client creates queries which response is 3D object definition of the queried terrain area. Client places received XML3D definition directly to the DOM tree, which leads rendering terrain object to the display.</li>
             <li>When server is properly configured, 3D building models can be placed to the terrain with selecting them in <i>Select objects</i> -section.</li>
             <li>Test asset PostGis data contains different level of details information. This can be tested bu using <i>Set Level Of Details</i> list, LOD values between 4-10 are used.</li>
         </ul>
         <br/>
         <li><a href="GIS_Client_assetInstancing/index.xhtml">Asset instance example client</a></li>
           <ul>
            <li>This example demonstrates GIS GE capability to create and provide 3D terrain object files, which can be referenced directly from the DOM instead of adding whole object definition to the DOM tree. Benefit of this approach is cleaner DOM treee even with complicated scenes.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <li><a href="GIS_Client_DEM/index.xhtml">Example client for DEM Geotiff usage as for source for 3D terrain</a></li>
           <ul>
            <li>Here is demonstration of using grascale DEM model as for source to 3D terrain creation. Data response is in octet-stream format, which contains elevation points for the queried area. This data is used as a source for creatin 3D terrain.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <li><a href="GIS_Client_octet-stream/index.xhtml">Octet-stream example client</a></li>
           <ul>
            <li>Example client queries elevation data which response format is octet-stream. This data is used as a source for creatin 3D terrain. </li>
        </ul>	
    </ul>
